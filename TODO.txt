Stovetop (2025)
By Oliver Hughes (Yeskonerism)

TODO:
    For MVP:
        Runtime verification (read shell output after 'which' command)
        Console and/or shell
        Config editing, viewing, verification, doctoring
        Alias editing and viewing
        Run/build/deploy command profiles
        Deploy command
        Hook editing
        User specific template file/full template '.stove/' directory
        Autogenerated '.stove/hooks' or '.stove/scripts' directory
    For the Future:
        Infrastructure (probably Pylon integration)
        Dependency management
        Runtime specific configuration
        Stringing commands together with '&&'
        Prettify like react + vite/svelte project setup
        
DONE:
    Build command
