# *Stovetop (2025)*
## By Oliver Hughes (Yeskonerism)

## Roadmap
### Minimum Viable Product *(where stove needs to be for a first version release)*<br>
#### Install scripts for multiple platforms
> - Batch files for Windows and Bash scripts for Linux/MacOS systems that builds Stovetop and adds its executable to the PATH
#### Check and compare the current path running from 
> - If in '.stove/', then default to workingDirectory given in config
#### Path keys for JSON 
> - Supply the config file with links to certain files or directories
> - Such as: project file, main file, asset directory etc.
#### Support multiple projects
> - Allow stove to run specific configs for specific projects in the same directory / solution
> - For example, launch backend, verify, then launch frontend (2 separate projects)
#### Runtime verification
> - Before running or building a project configured with stove, verify that the specified runtime actually exists
> - Probably through reading the console output after the "which" command (or platform equivalent)
#### Console and/or shell
> - Built-in stove console - rather than prefixxing commands with 'stove', launch stove console to execute commands in shorthand (such as just "run")
> - Built-in shell which functions the same as the stove console, but instead has the ability to handle terminal commands (launching bash scripts, seperate runtimes/compilers etc.)
#### Config editing, viewing, verification, doctoring 
> - Built-in commands for editing stove's config, as opposed to editing the raw JSON file
> - Command usage such as "stove config edit" to bring up an interactive menu
> - Verify config exists, verify no necessary fields are null or empty, verify runtime exists, be able to automatically/semi-automatically fix a broken config etc.
> - Alias editing and viewing 
> - Hook editing and viewing (pre-run and post-run)
#### Run/build/deploy command profiles
> - Specific profiles to override given commands in the main config file
#### Deploy command
> - A built-in command for websites, live products and containers that can deploy to a specified target
#### User specific template file/full template '.stove/' directory
> - Global template file(s) full of default and null values (the user can change this to set things like default runtimes, pre-run and post-run hooks and profiles)
> - Possibly global language-specific template files (dotnet, python, unity etc.)
#### Autogenerated '.stove/hooks' or '.stove/scripts' directory
> - Generate a project specific hook/script directory inside .stove with default bash scripts (echo starting/ending)
#### Optional backup restore if previous config has been overwritten
> - Currently stove already creates a backup of a previous config if a user re-initialises their project with stove
> - Users should be able to run a command to either run or revert to this version
> - Possibly implement metadata to track versions under the hood
#### Run configurations (Debug, Release etc.)
> - Be able to tell stove how to build and run projects similarly to how Visual Studio does
### For the Future:
#### Infrastructure (probably Pylon integration)
> - Not a lot on this yet, just you wait *wink wink*
#### Dependency management
> - Create a stovetop.lock file with a list of necessary project dependencies
> - Check and verify if user has said project dependencies before the main process starts, if they dont, then download or at the very least inform them
#### Runtime specific configuration (XML parsing - csproj/sln etc.)
> - For example, check a *.csproj file and parse its values to compare its framework version (.NET9.0) to the current runtimes framework version (.NET8.0) and configure accordingly
#### Stringing commands together with '&&'
> - This is cool, I like this, it's very self-explanatory
#### Prettify like react + vite/svelte project setup
> - Tools like React + Vite make a very nice project creation/configuration experience with their interactive menu's and text coloring
> - I want this
#### Global project calling (e.g. stove run --project [project name])
> - Every time a user initialises a project with stove, add the path to a global, locally stored list of path's to stove projects
> - Then theoretically, the user could call any one of these projects by name and stove will loop through all the paths to find a project with said name
> - If it finds one, it'll run it. If it doesn't, it'll warn the user

### FOR VERY VERY VERY FAR IN THE FUTURE:
#### Run specific project git commits (pull from specific git commits and run remotely)
> - git integration for running specific project versions/commits off of it
